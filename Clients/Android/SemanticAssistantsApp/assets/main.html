<p align="justify">Semantic Assistants support you in content retrieval, analysis, and development, by offering context-sensitive NLP services directly integrated in various clients, like a word processor or hand held devices.
</p><p align="justify">
Our assistants are implemented through an open service-oriented architecture, using Semantic Web ontologies and W3C Web Services.

Pre-requisite to Firefox and Thunderbird

1-Go to JDK install path

In there, go to /jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so

for example:
/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_20/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so


2-Go to the firefox install folder

for example:
/usr/lib/firefox-3.0.19

OR

go to the mozilla folder, which is usually at

/usr/lib/mozilla

^ this may be better as it SHOULD be used by both Thunderbird and Firefox

3-Go to the plugins folder in there

for example:
/usr/lib/firefox-3.0.19/plugins
OR
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins

4-Open a Terminal window there and copy:

ln -s PATH-TO-THE-JDK/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so .

for example:
ln -s /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_20/jre/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so .

and backup the openJDK file then REMOVE/delete it

libjavaplugin_oji.so

If it's in the plugins folder
especially if it's in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins

<br>This will install and set-up <b>Semantic Assistants</b> on your system.</br>
<br></br>
<br>The Semantic Assistants project aims to bring natural language processing (NLP) techniques
directly to end users by integrating them with common desktop applications, such as word
processors, email clients, or Web browsers. To facilitate this integration, a service-oriented
architecture has been developed that allows to integrate (desktop) clients with
NLP services implemented in the GATE framework</br>
<br></br>
<br>For the general motivation, design, and background on the Semantic Assistants project,
please read the information on the Semantic Assistants Web site and the contained references
first (Gitzinger and Witte, 2008; Witte and Gitzinger, 2009). This document only
describes the installation and use of the developed system.</br>

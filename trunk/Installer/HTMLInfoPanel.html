<p>The Semantic Assistants project aims to bring natural language processing (NLP) techniques
directly to end users by integrating them with common desktop applications, such as word
processors, email clients, or Web browsers. To facilitate this integration, a service-oriented
architecture has been developed that allows to integrate (desktop) clients with
NLP services implemented in the GATE framework.</p>
